Problem Statement 3: Explain the code snippet

This is my explanation for the given code snippet.

1.Explaining how the highlighted constructs work?
First the channel(make(chan func(), 10))
-its a buffered channel which can hold up 10 func() which dont have any params or return values
- so if this is full adding more things will wait

Second is the Goroutine(go func())
- This will start the task right way with the main program
- But the main program wont wait it to finish

Third is the LOOP(for i:=0;i<4;i++)
- this creates 4 different workers and they start immediately

Fourth is for loop inside (for f := range cnp)
- Each worker waits and watches the buffered cnp
- When something happens the worker takes it and they finish it
- Once they finish they go back and watch for more

At last the sending( cnp <- func())
- Here we put one task to the buffered cnp
- The 4 workers will take it and do it

2. Giving use-cases of what these constructs could be used for.
This could be used for
- Web server handling HTTP requets (worker pool pattern)
- Processing multiple files concurrently
- Image processing pipelines etc..

3. What is the significance of the for loop with 4 iterations?
- Here we create 4 concurrent workers
- They can handle 4 tasks simultaneously

4. What is the significance of make(chan func(), 10)?
- Its a buffered channel that can hold 10 functions without any blocking
- This allows asynchronous operations.

5. Why is “HERE1” not getting printed?
- Because of race condition
- Main function does not wait for the worker goroutines. Because of this it exits before the workers can do their jobs.
